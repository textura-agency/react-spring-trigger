# :japanese_castle: React-Three-Next starter

## Extended from: https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-next, and preconfigured for our case

A minimalist starter for NextJS, @react-three/fiber & react-spring.

This starter allows you to navigate seamlessly between pages with dynamic dom and/or canvas content without reloading or creating a new canvas every time. 3D components are usable anywhere in the dom. The events, dom, viewport, everything is synchronized!

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Thanks to [tunnel-rat](https://github.com/pmndrs/tunnel-rat) the starter can portal components between separate renderers. Anything rendered inside the `<View/>` component of the starter will be rendered in the 3D Context. For better performances it uses gl.scissor to cut the viewport into segments.

```jsx
<div>
  <View orbit>
    <Dog scale={2} />
    // Some 3D components will be rendered here
  </View>
</div>
```
